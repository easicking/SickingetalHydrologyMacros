This project contains the code and data necessary to reproduce figures 3-11 in the Sicking et al.
manuscript based on the results of my master's thesis (chapter 2). 

Each R script contains the code and csvs needed to complete each analysis or data visualization:
HydrologyVisuals.R creates Figure 3, and provides analysis code.
EmergenceBenthicNMDS.R creates Figures 4 and 5, and provides analysis code.
ProportionOverTime.R creates Figure 6, provides analysis code, and density proportions.
TotalRichnessBiomass.R creates Figure 11.
ChangeOverTime.R creates Figures 7, 8, 9, and 10.
RichnessBiomassAnalysis.R provides analysis code for Figures 7-10.
